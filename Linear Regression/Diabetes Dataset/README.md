Diabetes Dataset - Linear Regression Model

This repository contains an implementation of a Linear Regression Model on the Diabetes Dataset from sklearn.datasets. The goal of this project is to predict diabetes progression based on given medical features.

Dataset Overview

The Diabetes dataset consists of 10 medical features used to predict the diabetes progression measured one year after baseline.

Implementation Details

Dataset: Scikit-learn's built-in Diabetes dataset

Model Used: Linear Regression

Libraries Used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

Model Performance

Below are the key evaluation metrics for the trained model:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): XX.XXXX

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): XX.XXXX

RÂ² Score: XX.XXXX

(Replace XX.XXXX with actual computed values)

Scatter Plot of Predictions

To visualize the model's predictions, we created a scatter plot comparing actual values (y_test) and predicted values (y_pred).

import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.scatterplot(x=y_test, y=y_pred)
plt.xlabel("Actual Values (y_test)")
plt.ylabel("Predicted Values (y_pred)")
plt.title("Actual vs Predicted Diabetes Progression")
plt.show()

Key Observations

A strong diagonal trend in the scatter plot would indicate accurate predictions.

High dispersion from the diagonal suggests room for improvement.

Feature importance analysis showed that the most influential features are:

Feature 1: X.XXXX

Feature 2: X.XXXX

(Replace with actual feature names and coefficients)

Possible Improvements

To further improve the model, consider:

Trying Polynomial Regression to capture non-linearity.

Implementing Feature Scaling for better performance.

Exploring Ridge/Lasso Regression to handle multicollinearity.
